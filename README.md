# Machine Learning Reading Group

A machine learning reading group led by (member1), (member2), and (member3).

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Python programming is required. If not, you can refer to the following free [lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4) on Python basics or the Python tutorials in the Jupyter notebook files located in the `python` folder.

Python tutorial notes in the `python` folder might go a little further than the lecture video.

Also, experience in introductory calculus and linear algebra is sufficient, while mathematical maturity, such as the ability to read and understand proofs, may further enhance your learning.
